# PacketSniffer

Important note: You must run this program in linux. Windows and OS X do not support many of the socket protocols I used. 

To run, simply download the program, `cd` into the directory that you saved the program in, and run the program
like any other Python file from the terminal (You must run as `sudo`):

`sudo python3 packetSniffer.py`

Results will be shown in the terminal window.
